      "reasoning": "Giannis dominated with 37 points in their opener despite being listed as Probable (toe), showing he's ready to perform. The Bucks' offensive efficiency (125.3 ORtg) and three-point shooting (40.9% on 44 attempts) gives them a significant edge. Gary Trent Jr. went 5-for-11 from deep in game one, and both teams combined for 271 points in their openers, suggesting a high-scoring affair is likely to continue.",

RJ Barrett exploded for 25 points on 75% shooting with 8 rebounds, while Scottie Barnes dished out 9 assists showing elite playmaking. The Raptors' home court advantage and superior defensive rating (105.5 vs Bucks' 113.1) gives them a strong foundation. Poeltl's 6 rebounds in 22 minutes should easily exceed this line with more involvement.",

      "reasoning": "These are extremely conservative lines based on opener performance. Giannis grabbed 14 rebounds in 27 minutes, RJ Barrett had 8 rebounds, and Scottie Barnes distributed 9 assists while being the primary facilitator. Both teams averaged 135.5 points in their openers with fast-paced play (106.1 and 111.8 pace), making the total points line very beatable. All three players are primary offensive options with consistent usage rates.",
