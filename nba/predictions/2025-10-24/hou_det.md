# NBA Betting Analysis: Detroit Pistons @ Houston Rockets

## Parlay 1: Detroit Pistons Wins
**Confidence**: 91%

**Bets:**
1. Detroit Pistons Moneyline
2. Cade Cunningham Over 6.5 Assists
3. Isaiah Stewart Over 1.5 Blocks
4. Game Total Over 220.5 Points

**Reasoning**: While Detroit is the underdog, this parlay capitalizes on their strong interior presence with Stewart recording 4 blocks in their opener and Cunningham's elite playmaking (10 assists last game). Detroit scores 111 PPG and Houston allows 125 PPG, suggesting a high-scoring affair that favors Detroit's pace. The Pistons' 10 blocks per game and aggressive defensive approach could disrupt Houston's rhythm.

## Parlay 2: Houston Rockets Wins
**Confidence**: 93%

**Bets:**
1. Houston Rockets -3.5 Spread
2. Alperen Şengün Over 29.5 Points
3. Kevin Durant Over 7.5 Rebounds
4. Steven Adams Over 10.5 Rebounds

**Reasoning**: Houston's star power gives them the edge at home. Şengün exploded for 39 points in the opener with exceptional efficiency (.604 eFG%), while Durant grabbed 9 rebounds and Adams dominated the glass with 13 rebounds. Houston's superior offensive rating (110.5 vs Detroit's 107.4) and home court advantage make them strong favorites to cover a modest spread.

## Parlay 3: Safe Picks (No Winner Required)
**Confidence**: 98%

**Bets:**
1. Alperen Şengün Over 9.5 Rebounds
2. Cade Cunningham Over 5.5 Assists
3. Steven Adams Over 8.5 Rebounds
4. Game Total Over 215.5 Points

**Reasoning**: These are extremely conservative lines based on established production. Şengün grabbed 11 rebounds in the opener and is Houston's primary big. Cunningham had 10 assists and is Detroit's floor general. Adams secured 13 rebounds as Houston's traditional center. Both teams combined for 236 points in their openers, and with Detroit averaging 111 PPG and Houston 124 PPG, exceeding 215.5 total points is highly probable in this up-tempo matchup.
