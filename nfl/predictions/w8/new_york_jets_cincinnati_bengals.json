      "reasoning": "The Jets are 0-7 but facing a Bengals team without Joe Burrow (IR) and with major defensive issues (31st in points allowed). Cincinnati's backup QBs have struggled with 8 interceptions in recent games. The Jets' strong rushing attack (7th ranked) should control the game against Cincinnati's 32nd-ranked rush defense.",

Ja'Marr Chase is averaging 89.9 yards per game, and the Jets' pass defense has been exploitable. The Bengals' passing attack should find success against New York's secondary.",

      "reasoning": "Fields is averaging 14.3 completions per game over 6 games, making 25.5 very conservative. Chase leads the league in targets (80) and averages 8.3 receptions per game. Both teams have reliable kickers (Folk 14/14 FGs, McPherson 10/12 FGs) and struggle in the red zone, making field goals likely. These are extremely safe statistical plays based on season-long consistency.",
