## Parlay 1: Minnesota Vikings Wins
**Confidence**: 78%

**Bets:**
1. Minnesota Vikings Moneyline
2. Justin Jefferson Over 75.5 receiving yards
3. Under 47.5 total points
4. Cameron Dicker Under 3.5 field goals

**Reasoning**: Minnesota's defense ranks 5th in points allowed per game (18.6) and should contain LA's inconsistent offense that averages only 21.6 PPG. The Vikings have shown they can win ugly games, and with Jefferson back healthy, they have the offensive weapon advantage in what projects to be a lower-scoring Thursday night affair.

## Parlay 2: Los Angeles Chargers Wins
**Confidence**: 76%

**Bets:**
1. Los Angeles Chargers Moneyline
2. Justin Herbert Over 265.5 passing yards
3. Ladd McConkey Over 55.5 receiving yards
4. Over 45.5 total points

**Reasoning**: Herbert is having an excellent season (273.3 YPG, 94.5 rating) and faces a Vikings defense that allows 184.0 passing yards per game. At home on Thursday night, the Chargers' superior passing attack should exploit Minnesota's 25th-ranked passing offense, controlling the game tempo and pulling away late.

## Parlay 3: Safe Picks (No Winner Required)
**Confidence**: 92%

**Bets:**
1. Justin Herbert Over 245.5 passing yards
2. Justin Jefferson Over 65.5 receiving yards
3. Omarion Hampton Over 45.5 rushing yards
4. Over 44.5 total points

**Reasoning**: Herbert averages 273.3 YPG and should easily clear this conservative line against Minnesota's pass defense. Jefferson is Minnesota's top target (88.0 YPG when healthy) and will see heavy volume. Hampton has been LA's workhorse back with 62.8 YPG over his last 5 games, making this an extremely safe rushing prop for consistent production.
